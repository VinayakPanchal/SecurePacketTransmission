# SecurePacketTransmission

1. A Network application using socket API to implement simple end-to-end encryption and decryption of a file. 

2. It uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to exchange keys and incorporated AES-128 for data encryption and decryption.

3. It is developed in Java without any use of library functions. All the stages of encryption were manually coded
